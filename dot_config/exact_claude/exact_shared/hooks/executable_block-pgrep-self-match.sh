#
#              A shell's own options end at its first operand: past that word it is running a

#              reading it as a payload is a false deny. Budget 0.
#

# @description Find the payloads of local shell wrappers and print each one's raw text,
#              NUL-terminated, with any surrounding quotes stripped.
#
#              A `-c` payload counts only when all three hold: the wrapper is in command position
#              (so `ssh host bash -c ...` and a bare `echo bash -c ...` are both skipped, since
#              neither runs the payload here); a `-c` precedes it, in the same simple command,
#              within the wrapper's operand budget (see wrapper_operand_budget -- this is what
#              keeps `bash deploy.sh -c '...'`, where the `-c` belongs to the script, from being
#              read as a payload); and the raw slice is a single fully quoted word. That last
#              condition is what keeps the recursion honest -- a double-quoted payload containing
#              a command substitution is NOT one opaque token, because the scanner deliberately
#              re-enters code context inside `$(...)`, and the outer scan can already see the
#              substitution for itself. Slicing a fragment of such a payload and recursing on it
#              would classify text that is not a command.
#
#              A heredoc feeding the wrapper's stdin (`bash <<'EOF'`, `sudo sh <<EOF`, `0<<EOF
#              bash`) is a payload too: the body is the script the wrapper runs, here (#184). A
#              heredoc operator may carry an explicit fd like any other redirection (`0<<EOF`,
#              `3<<-EOF`); only fd 0 -- explicit or, far more commonly, the implicit default --
#              feeds the wrapper's stdin, so `bash 3<<EOF` is skipped: it redirects a different fd,
#              not the one the wrapper reads its script from. A heredoc counts when its operator is
#              seen in the wrapper's simple command with no `-c` before it and the simple command
#              then ends without an operand spending the budget -- an operand makes the body that
#              script's stdin instead, unless a `-s` in a short flag cluster already said stdin IS
#              the script, in which case the operands are its positional parameters and the body
#              still runs here -- and, once `-s` has taken an operand, so is a later `-c`, which is
#              then just another positional word and starts no payload.
#
#              Any other redirection in the same simple command (`bash <<EOF >
#              /tmp/log`, `bash <<EOF 2>&1`) is neither an operand nor a flag: it leaves both the
#              budget and the pending heredoc alone.
#
#              A redirection may precede the command word it attaches to
#              (`<<EOF bash`, `sudo <<EOF bash`), so a stdin heredoc seen while still hunting for
#              the command word is remembered and, once that word turns out to be a wrapper,
#              counted as its payload exactly as one written after the word would be. Both
#              delimiter forms count: the body text is what runs either way, and a `$(...)` inside
#              an unquoted body is seen by the outer scan and the recursion alike. The scanner
#              announces each body with a `<HD:len>` marker at the body's first byte, in operator
#              order, so a heredoc's ordinal among all `<<` tokens -- fd-prefixed or not -- is its
#              body's ordinal among the markers.
#
#              Two shapes are deliberately not covered: `cat <<EOF | bash`, where the body does run
#              in bash but the heredoc feeds `cat`, so seeing it needs pipeline data-flow this
#              scanner does not model; and `sudo -u user bash <<EOF`, the pre-existing prefix-chain
#              limitation that stops the wrapper being recognised at all -- identical for `-c`.
#
#              Payloads are NUL-terminated because a heredoc body is usually several lines and
#              has to reach classify_command as one command.
#
#              Command position is tracked exactly as find_invocations tracks it, including the
#              prefix-word chain, so `sudo bash -c ...` is reached.
