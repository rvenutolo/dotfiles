# Mask quoted regions and emit tokens with byte offsets, in one linear pass.
# A command substitution re-enters an unquoted context even inside double
# quotes, because the shell expands it there -- that is what makes
# `until [ -z "$(pgrep --full x)" ]` visible to the scanner.
#
# An unquoted `#` that starts a word opens a comment, which the shell ignores to
# end of line. Masking it matters in both directions: a single apostrophe in
# prose ("it's", "don't") otherwise inverts quote parity for the whole rest of
# the command, which has been observed both exposing a quoted string as if it
# were code and hiding a real poll loop inside a quoted region.
#
# A heredoc body is text the shell feeds to a command, not code (#184). Its
# bytes are masked from the newline after the `<<` line to the terminator
# line, which is masked too. A quoted delimiter (`<<'EOF'`, `<<"EOF"`,
# `<<\EOF`) masks everything; an unquoted one masks like a double-quoted
# string, so `$(` and backticks still re-enter code context. One body is
# emitted to the tokenizer as a `<HD:len>` marker at its first byte, which is
# how the hook slices a body fed to a local shell wrapper.
